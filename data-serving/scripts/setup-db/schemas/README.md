# Mongodb schema validators

This directory contains schema validators and index files for the various collections stored in mongodb.
These are the _initial_ state of the database: do not make changes here, as they won't make any difference in production!
Modifications are made via migrations: every new change requires a new migration. See the `migrations` folder for more information.
