METADATA

 1. _id *

    This is not expected to be stable.

 2. caseReference.additionalSources []

 3. caseReference.sourceEntryId

    Unique source entry ID. This is only present in sources that
    offer this information.

 4. caseReference.sourceId *

    a specific source URL, which has an unique ID. This is
    stable for a particular source.

 6. caseReference.uploadIds [] *

    Subsequent uploads following the initial upload of a case can
    change the data of a case (only in sources that provide an
    unique ID in caseReference.sourceEntryId). This field records
    the unique upload IDs that updated this case.

 7. caseReference.verificationStatus *

    Case verification status
    Values: VERIFIED | UNVERIFIED | EXCLUDED

      VERIFIED: Case was verified by a curator after ingestion
    UNVERIFIED: Case was automatically ingested without verification

    Most of our automated data ingestion is from authoritative
    government datasets, with a few from volunteer-operated datasets.
