    a specific source URL, which has an unique ID. This is
    stable for a particular source.

 5. caseReference.sourceUrl *

    Data URL from which this case was ingested.

 6. caseReference.uploadIds [] *

    Subsequent uploads following the initial upload of a case can

    Most of our automated data ingestion is from authoritative
    government datasets, with a few from volunteer-operated datasets.
