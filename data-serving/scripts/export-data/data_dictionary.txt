array.

* marks mandatory fields

METADATA

 1. _id *

    This is not expected to be stable.

 2. caseReference.additionalSources []

    Additional sources (URLs) for this case

 3. caseReference.sourceId *

    a specific source URL, which has an unique ID. This is
    stable for a particular source.

 4. caseReference.sourceUrl *

    Data URL from which this case was ingested.

 5. caseReference.uploadIds [] *

    Subsequent uploads following the initial upload of a case can
    change the data of a case (only in sources that provide an
    unique ID in caseReference.sourceEntryId). This field records
    the unique upload IDs that updated this case.

 6. caseReference.verificationStatus *

    Case verification status
    Values: VERIFIED | UNVERIFIED | EXCLUDED

      VERIFIED: Case was verified by a curator after ingestion
    UNVERIFIED: Case was automatically ingested without verification
      EXCLUDED: Case has been excluded from the line list

    Most of our automated data ingestion is from authoritative
    government datasets, with a few from volunteer-operated datasets.
