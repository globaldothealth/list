# The docs folder

This is the home for high-level project documentation that doesn't belong in any specific component in the repository. The motivation for keeping it here is that it gets version-controlled alongside the source so there's a slight chance we remember to keep it up to date :D.

## Diagrams

Diagrams are made with [plantUML](https://plantuml.com), see their website for example syntax, documentation, and the full range of image types available (not just the UML diagrams). To re-generate diagrams after you update the source, run `make` in this folder.
