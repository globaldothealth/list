# Development setup

This directory contains scripts to set up, run, and test the full stack during development, including:

- `run_stack.sh`: A script to run the dev docker compose file that runs an isolated environment of the full stack.
- `setup-db.sh`: A script to that connects to your locally-running MongoDB instance and (re-)creates the database and
  collection, applies the schema, and inserts some sample data.
- `test_all.sh`: A script to run all of the tests from the sub-packages.

What, exactly, is this stack that we're running and/or testing? All of the components of this repo working together: a
curator UI server that talks to a curator API server that talks to a data server. More concretely, a user can log into
the curator UI to manage case report data sources and view or update case data, with more functionality coming soon.

## Getting up and running

### Prerequisites

#### Software

- [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation): To facilitate installing the below.
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/): Make sure, after install, you can run
  both the `mongo` and `mongoimport` CLIs. (They may need to be added to your path.)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

#### Secrets

**Important:** running the full stack correctly requires having access to a few secrets: you should create a `.env` file
at the top of your repository (where you run the `run_stack.sh` command) that looks like this:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret access key to authenticate AWS API calls>
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<oauth client id to enable OAuth>
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<oauth client secret>
```

#### Permissions

Give your curator service user all the permissions to access the portal and make CRUD updates. From the project root:

```shell
mongo "mongodb://localhost:27017/covid19" --eval 'var email="<YOUR-GOOGLE-LOGIN>"; var
roles=["admin", "curator", "reader"];' verification/scripts/roles.js
```

### Let's run this thing!

Once you've done all of the prereqs above, go ahead and:

1. Start the MongoDB daemon with `mongod`
1. Run `./dev/setup_db.sh` to set up the collection and load up some toy data
1. Run `./dev/run_stack.sh`
1. Navigate to `localhost:3002`
1. Experience success

## Understanding the setup

### Environment variables

All services require specific environment variables to be set when running.

Specific `.env` files in each service directory are used when you run `npm run dev` from the service directory directly.

If you run the docker-compose script described below to run the whole stack, environment variables should be passed in
the docker-compose.dev.yml environment overrides or in the docker-compose `.env` file itself in this directory. No
service-specific `.env` files are included in the docker compose build as we shouldn't put secrets into docker images.

### Docker

During development, you can run each service individually using `docker` or plug them together using `docker-compose`.

`docker-compose` is also used by Github actions to make sure services are working well together all the time.

### All services composed with hot reload

Just run `./dev/run_stack.sh` from anywhere.

Services will be accessible and connected to each other.

### Running services individually

#### Mongo

Official docs: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo

To run `mongod` locally, expose its default port (27017), connected to a default `test` database, run:

```shell
docker run --rm --name mongod -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Note: data is persisted in the DB between runs unless you specify the --rm flag.

To run a `mongo` shell in that container and play with the DB:

```shell
docker exec -it mongod mongo
```

You can also just run `mongo` from your workstation if you have it installed.

##### How to clear cases data?

By default docker wil persist the container data unless you rm it, to remove data in the db first run a mongo shell as
explained above then:

```js
use covid19
db.cases.remove({})
```

## IDE setup

If you're using VSCode, `.vscode/settings.json` contains useful default settings for working with Typescript and NodeJS.

## Update of dependencies

You can update all node dependencies for the services to their latest minor version by running the `dev/update_deps.sh` script.
