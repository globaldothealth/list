    New Zealand case data has no UUIDs, and provides just 6 fields:

    Age group - we convert 90+ to ageRange of 90 - 120
    Case Status - (confirmed/suspected), we take only confirmed
    DHB (where the case lives - listed as "Managed isolation & quarantine" for border cases)
    Overseas Travel - boolean, no details on where. We assume this means travel in last 30 days.
    Report Date
    Sex

    We only count cases with a Report Date and with Status=Confirmed

    Cases arriving to NZ from 'Overseas' are geocoded generically to 'New Zealand'. Cases arising in NZ should
