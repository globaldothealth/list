# Global.health List

[Global.health](https://global.health)'s mission is to enable rapid sharing of trusted and open public health data to
advance the response to infectious diseases.

This repository contains the servers and scripts that support its data curation efforts.

Should you have any questions please feel free to get in touch via: info@global.health

## COVID-19 Data

The data exposed on Global.health was curated using two methods. ~60,000 cases were manually curated by humans analyzing sources and inputting data into spreadsheets. This data was ported from the spreadsheets into the Curator Portal as described [here](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/blob/main/data-serving/scripts/convert-data#converting-line-list-data). The rest of the data was automatically ingested from sources through a process described [here](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/tree/main/ingestion/functions#ingestion-functions). Each case is marked as `VERIFIED` if a human has confirmed this data is valid or `UNVERIFIED` if it has not yet been reviewed.

You can tell if a case was imported from the manually created spreadsheets data in a couple of ways. The case will be marked as created by covid19_spreadsheets@googlegroups.com. It will also have a source URL that links to this documentation. The source URL that was used to find data about these cases can be found in the additional sources section of the detailed case view (found by clicking on the table row).

## Frontends

### COVID-19

- [dev](https://dev-data.covid-19.global.health)
- [prod](https://data.covid-19.global.health)

## Daily exports of case data

A daily export of case data can be downloaded from the data portal. The data
is generated using this [script](data-serving/scripts/export-data/README.md), with
this [data dictionary](data-serving/scripts/export-data/data_dictionary.txt).

## Components

- [The data service](data-serving/data-service) in `data-serving/data-service` facilitates CRUD operations with the
  MongoDB database storing case data.
- [The curator service](verification/curator-service/api) in `verification/curator-service/api` serves as the backend
  for the curator portal, which enables curators to view, enter, update, and verify cases; manage data sources and their
  ingestion; and manage portal access.
- [The geocoding service](geocoding/location-service) geocodes locations and is
  used by the data service, but can be used standalone as well.
- [The curator UI](verification/curator-service/ui) in `verification/curator-service/ui` is the frontend for the curator
  portal.
