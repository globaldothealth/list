# So You Want To Contribute to Global.health

That's great! Find an open issue, familiarise yourself with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and we look forward to your pull request. This document is more for the core team to share how we schedule tasks for a release, how we keep up to date with who's working on what, that sort of thing.

## Milestones

Issues that are planned to be in a particular release should be attached to that [milestone](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/milestones). We never hold up releasing a fix because it's waiting for the next milestone: if it's in `main`, it'll go live soon. The milestones are there to help us understand what's urgent, and what can wait.

## Priorities

Priorities tell us what's important, and there are three levels: [P0 is on fire](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/labels/P0%3A%20Critical%20path%20blocker), [P1 is smouldering a little](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/labels/P1%20Launch%20blocker), [P2 would be nice to have](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/labels/P2%3A%20Nice%20to%20have). These are labels that can be attached to issues.

## Assignees

If you're working on an issue, please assign yourself to it. If nobody is working on issue (for example it's newly-added), there should be no assignees. The corollary is that if there are assignees, we might assume somebody _else_ is working on it and not pick it up ourselves, with the result that it never gets done.

## Kanban boards

We did try using a [Github project board](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/projects/2) to track this stuff but found that it wasn't sufficiently up-to-date to be useful, so we're abandoning it. Our colleagues at HTD are very good at [keeping their project board up to date](https://github.com/globaldothealth/list/projects/1), so we'll assume that anything on that board is being worked on by them.
